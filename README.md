# Udaci Cards


Versions Tested: iOS

To run the application:

- Start the app:
  1. ```yarn install```
  2. ```yarn start```
  3. When the app server has started, press `i` to start the iOS simulator (assuming Xcode, etc has been set up)

Note: Sometimes `yarn install` fails to install all the packages. Simply do `npm install` in that case, an then follow the remaining steps.
