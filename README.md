# UdaciCards

Project for the React Native course in Udacity's React Nanodegree.

UdaciCards lets you create flash cards for your Questions and Answers, and arrange them in decks.

To run the application:

- Start the app:
  1. ```yarn install```
  2. ```yarn start```
  3. When the app server has started, press `i` to start the iOS simulator (assuming Xcode, etc has been set up)

_Note: Sometimes `yarn install` fails to install all the packages. Simply do `npm install` in that case, an then follow the remaining steps._

Versions Tested: iOS
